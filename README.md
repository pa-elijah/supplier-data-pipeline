# Project: Supplier Data Integration & Analysis Pipeline

Welcome to my submission for the Supplier Data Integration & Analysis Pipeline task!

## Installation

## Assumptions

Here are some assumptions I made for this task:

Task 1.

- The `cost_price` column only has three different types of values: a number, NaN, or a string with a dollar sign in front of a number

- The dates that are of the form `03/04/24` are `mm/dd/yy` (month first)
